# 2048_py
#### Python implementation for 2048
### how does it work?
each "Game" instance contains a  4x4 martix, which represent the board. the functions `pushUp`,`puchDown`,`pushRight` and `pushLeft` can manipulate the board according to player's request in the cli. The game will stop if the player lost.
uncomment the last two lines in  `main.py` and run the script using `python3 main.py` to play.
